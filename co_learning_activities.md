* [Project-based learning](project_based_learning)
We believe working on real-world projects help hone oneâ€™s skills. We collectively curate and select some of these projects and work with experienced community members in solving them. This program is for people who have prior experience in relevant technologies like CV, NLP, ML, etc.

* [Collaborative Learning](collaborative_learning)
Platform like Kaggle post real-world problems as competitions. Experts solves, share, and discuss their solution. We prefer to start by learning from problems already solved by experts. Hence interested folks from the community come together and try to solve the problem again by keeping existing solution and discussion as a reference. Once you head to the next level, you can work alongside a mentor to work on unsolved problem statements to gain first hand experience time-critical problems.

* Tutorial-based learning
  - Tutorials are based on tentative sessions, conducted by authors through the co-learning lounge community on this global platform.
  - We give chances to almost everyone, learning/learned groups to come up and show something to the world.
  - If in any tutorial you have some doubts or difficulties we connect you with the authors directly without keeping any possible gaps between a learner and the author.
  - The workshops will be conducted by these authors where they describe more on, what is done through learning by following the steps mentioned and gaining expertise from it.
  - The accessibility can be in the form of live/online webinars, where you get to interact with the author from a remote location, so no location condition.
  - You can create and submit your tutorial in [this](../Technology/Artificial%20Intelligence/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Concepts/Text%20Classification/Text%20Classification%20using%20Machine%20Learning) format.
