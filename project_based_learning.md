# Project-based learning:

### What’s this?
As the name suggests, in project-based learning, the co-learning lounge provides seekers [learners] with the amazing experience on building projects, with the help of industry experts to utilize their skills for not only just to create that simple project, but also to solve a real-world problem, It is based on the context of exploring and learning technical abilities/skills from a beginner/intermediate to an in-depth experience.

The industry experts not only help you understand the project from end to end but also they provide the in-depth exploration you require for solving the problem, including those glitches you face when enthusiastic.
So if you are in the category of seekers, you get to learn more and more from simple, yet challenging real-world problems.

As a contributor, we expect no less from you, as you are gonna be teaching and an expert we expect that you must know the understanding criterion for starting a project for the community.

Some of the ongoing projects, including real-world challenges in the community, are:
[Chatbot building using Rasa](../Technology/Artificial%20Intelligence/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Concepts/Chatbot/RASA)
[Chatbot building using Dialogflow](../Technology/Artificial%20Intelligence/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Concepts/Chatbot/Dialogflow)

### Being a Host, the responsibility you have are as follows:
The host is similar to a direction for the community, as his first and foremost objectives are to come up with a project plan, which is achievable, should also keep in mind about the requirements the project plan comes along with.

The host must be able to convey the project plan to the audience, because if he/she cannot do so, then “The one who does not understand, cannot transfer it to others.”

Since we understood the project, the community then announces it and the host starts to look for a candidate, who actually is skilled, and should know about the candidate about why they apply for this specific project.

The host should be able to understand the required criterion and the eligibility criterion for the project and filter out a candidate who seems best for the given project. And eventually, initiate the Solving of the real-world problem.
The host will be able to track the project on a Trello board followed with frequent sync up on the tasks listed on the board.

### How can you join our ongoing project?
Since the project has already commenced we are expecting the candidates applying at a later stage must have a perception about the phases/activities of the project executed in his/her absence.

You should be able to provide your feedback on the process, done until your absence, we expect you to skim through the project done until now, and share critical feedback or improvements [if seemed fit]. Once the above phases from your part get completed, then as a team member you will be assigned a task.

If you want to join on the project learning as the learner, then you have to thoroughly understand the project requirements and go through the entire project phases/activities done until now. Once you are eligible & capable to join our project then you can contribute, and learn with other members. 

### Who can join this project?
Those interested to join the ongoing project-based learning project(s) must thoroughly go through how-to join our ongoing project guide to get a better summary of what we expect from a candidate.

Regarding the technology enthusiasts, as mentioned in the how-to join our ongoing project guide, we expect them to have understood the project requirements and the following steps mentioned in the same guide.

With our previous experience, we always have got more interested people and the majority of them couldn't (simply) commit. If we find the same behavior with a candidate then we will not include in any of our future learning. So request to go through the requirement thoroughly and decide. OR if there are any questions please email us at colearninglounge@gmail.com

*Note: Irrespective of the group that you belong to, you must have enthusiasm in your actions, meaning when you join the project, we strongly believe in no Spoon Feeding*
