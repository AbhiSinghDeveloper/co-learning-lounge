# Collaborative Learning:
### Whatâ€™s this?
In collaborative learning, we try to combine different intellects or enthusiasts with each other for solving a single problem, with different techniques [and tools] these set of problems are from kaggle where we learn much more than just a single way to look at the problem but also the solutions and the diverse approaches.

Kaggle, not only is a single platform for competitions, but also a workspace for learning and doing things with greater community support and advice when you need it. As well they carry over real-life problems based on the problems currently faced by someone around the world, right now.

What we plan to achieve in collaborative learning under kaggle problems is to not only try different approaches to a single problem, by everyone. But also as a community, we plan to bring aid to everyone for helping them select a robust solution.
